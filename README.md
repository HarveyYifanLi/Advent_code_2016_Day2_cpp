# Advent_code_2016_Day2_cpp
These are the source files to the solutions of the two-part challenges of Day 2.

The challenges' instruction file that our programs need to take as input is:

Instruct_Doc.txt


For part1, the relavant source files are:

main.cpp  

valid_button_value.cpp  //This is the file that gives the definition of the valid_button_value() function appeared in main().

valid_button_value.h  //This is the header file that gives the declaration of the valid_button_value() function


For part2, the only source file is:


main_part2.cpp

Lastly, two successful execution screen-shots are shwon:
